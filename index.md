Five emergent layers—from embodied wisdom to world's raw data

| Layer | Role in Evidence Synthesis |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Embodied AI** | Audits the entire workflow—bias detection, equity checks, PRISMA compliance |
| **Generative AI** | Synthesizes findings into reports, policy briefs, and insights   |
| **[Agentic AI](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-ushers-in-new-era-of-ai-driven-electronic-health-records-2025-08-13/)** | Automates screening, extraction, and repetitive tasks  |
| **[Perception AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-rank/)** | Ingests literature across journals, languages, and grey sources   |
| **World AI** | Understands global health patterns, NCDs, TB, etc—the raw environment |
