Five [emergent layers](https://ukb-dt.github.io/fs-dev-00/)—from embodied wisdom to world's raw data

| Layer | Role in Evidence Synthesis |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **[Embodied AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_%28robot%29)** | Audits the entire workflow—bias detection, equity checks, PRISMA compliance |
| **[Generative AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/alpha/)** | Synthesizes findings into reports, policy briefs, and insights   |
| **[Agentic AI](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-ushers-in-new-era-of-ai-driven-electronic-health-records-2025-08-13/)** | Automates screening, extraction, and repetitive tasks  |
| **[Perception AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-rank/)** | Ingests literature across journals, languages, and grey sources   |
| **[World AI](https://gemini.google.com/app)** | Understands global health patterns, NCDs, TB, etc—the raw environment |
